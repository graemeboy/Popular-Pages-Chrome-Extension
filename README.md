Upload this to chrome as a chrome extension. When you navigate to a site, click the extension icon (which is currently a puzzle-piece, because I haven't made one yet.) You should see a little box appear, which will inform you of its process in crawling the current web page. The crawler is very quick, and should return the top 10 posts, as shared on social networking sites. These results will appear as a list of links.

The crawling process does not occur in Chrome's background, and therefore will not affect regular browsing speeds in any way - the process only begins on your clicking the icon.
